<h2>About Oreo Cookies</h2>
<p>
An Oreo is a sandwich cookie consisting of two (usually chocolate) wafers with a sweet crème filling. Introduced in 1912, Oreo is the best selling cookie brand in the United States.[3] As of 2018, the version sold in the U.S. is made by the Nabisco division of Mondelez International.

Oreos are available in over one hundred countries;[2] in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, they are referred to as Oreo biscuits. Many varieties of Oreo cookies have been produced, and limited-edition runs have become popular in the 21st century.

History

Representation of the trademarked pattern embossed onto the face of an Oreo cookie
Twentieth century
The "Oreo Biscuit" was first developed and produced by the National Biscuit Company (today known as Nabisco) in 1912[8][9] at its Chelsea, Manhattan factory in the current-day Chelsea Market complex, located on Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets.[10] Today, this same block of Ninth Avenue is known as "Oreo Way".[10] The name Oreo was first trademarked on March 14, 1912.[11] It was launched as an imitation of the Hydrox cookie manufactured by Sunshine company, which was introduced in 1908.[12]

The original design on the face of the Oreo featured a wreath around the edge of the cookie and the name "OREO" in the center.[13] In the United States, they were sold for 25 cents a pound (453 g) in novelty metal canisters with clear glass tops. The first Oreo was sold on March 6, 1912, to a grocer in Hoboken, New Jersey.[14]

The Oreo Biscuit was renamed in 1921 to "Oreo Sandwich"; in 1948, the name was changed to "Oreo Crème Sandwich"; and in 1974 it became the "Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookie",the name that has remained to this day. A new design for the face of the cookie was launched in 1924; the modern-day Oreo design was developed in 1952 by William A. Turnier,incorporating the Nabisco logo. In 1920, a second lemon crème-filled variety of the Oreo was introduced, as an alternative to the white crème-filled variety, but this was discontinued in 1924 and the original flavor was the only version available for the next several decades.

The modern Oreo cookie filling was developed by Nabisco's principal food scientist, Sam Porcello,who retired from Nabisco in 1993.Porcello held five patents directly related to his work on the Oreo;he also created a range of Oreo cookies that were covered in dark chocolate and white chocolate.In the early 1990s, health concerns prompted Nabisco to replace the lard in the crème filling with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Oreo cookies are popular with people that have certain dietary restrictions, such as vegans, as the crème filling does not use any animal products.However, there is still a risk of cross-contamination from other dairy-containing products made in the same production areas.

<h3>More About Oreo</h3>
<p>
	In January 2006, Nabisco replaced the trans fat in the Oreo cookie with non-hydrogenated vegetable oil.[18][21][22]

Nabisco began a marketing campaign in 2008, advertising the use of Oreo cookies in an online game called DSRL (which stands for "Double Stuf Racing League"), introduced the week before Super Bowl XLII. DSRL had been endorsed by football brothers Peyton Manning and Eli Manning;[23] the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, also joined, challenging the Mannings to a race that was aired in an advertisement on January 18, 2009.[24] Another campaign was launched for Golden Double Stuf Oreo cookies, in which the Manning brothers were challenged by Donald Trump and a character called "Double Trump", played by Darrell Hammond; this competition aired on January 24, 2010. The Mannings won both races. Another advertisement featured a "Hooded Menace" threatening to take over the DSRL, with Eli Manning and Stufy (the DSRL mascot) needing some help, which aired on September 14, 2010. Six days later, it was announced that Shaquille O'Neal and Apolo Ohno had joined Oreo's DSRL veterans Eli Manning and Venus Williams.


The 2012 rainbow Oreo advertisement supporting Pride month
In April 2011, Oreo announced its special edition Oreo cookies with blue crème to promote the 2011 3D computer-animated movie Rio. The promotion included stickers inside each package of cookies. Two contests were also announced: by completing an album of stickers, consumers could win three movie passes and medium snack bar combos; and prize stickers could be found in winning packages, including a trip to Rio de Janeiro, backpacks, cinema passes for a year, and 3D glasses. The promotion was available in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia, and ended on May 30, 2011.[25]

In June 2012, Oreo posted an advertisement displaying an Oreo cookie with rainbow colored crème to celebrate LGBT Pride month;[26] the cookie itself was fictional and was not being manufactured or made available for sale. The advertisement prompted some negative comments, but Kraft stood by their promotion, stating that "Kraft Foods has a proud history of celebrating diversity and inclusiveness. We feel the Oreo ad is a fun reflection of our values."[27] This was followed during 2012 by a series of adverts commemorating other holidays and events, including a blue, white, and red crème Oreo to honor Bastille Day, a stream of cookie crumbs marking the appearance of the Delta Aquariids meteor shower, and a cookie with a jagged bite taken out of it to promote Shark Week on The Discovery Channel.

<h3>International Distribution of Oreo</h3>
<p>
Oreo cookies are distributed worldwide through a variety of sales and marketing channels. As their popularity continues to grow, so too does the amount of distribution that comes with it. According to the Kraft Foods company, the Oreo is the "World's Best Selling Cookie".[28] In March 2012, Time magazine reported that Oreo cookies were available in more than 100 different countries. Overall, it is estimated that since the Oreo cookie's inception in 1912, over 450 billion Oreos have been produced worldwide.[14]

Oreo biscuits (as they are known in the United Kingdom) were first introduced into Britain through the supermarket chain Sainsbury's. For several years, this was the only store in the UK to stock the Oreo – until May 2008, when Kraft decided to fully launch the Oreo across the whole of the UK. It was repackaged in the more familiar British tube design, accompanied by a £4.5M television advertising campaign based around the "twist, lick, dunk" catchphrase.[29]

In the UK, Kraft partnered with McDonald's to introduce the Oreo McFlurry (which was already on sale in several other countries) into a number of McDonald's locations during its annual Great Tastes of America promotions; in October 2015, the Oreo McFlurry became a permanent menu item at McDonald's in the UK. An Oreo flavored "Krushem" drink was also on sale in KFC stores across Britain.

The ingredients of the British Oreo biscuit (as listed on the UK Oreo website) are slightly different from those of the US Oreo cookie. Unlike the US version, the British Oreo originally contained whey powder, which was not suitable for people with lactose intolerance. Additionally, as the whey powder was sourced from cheese made with calf rennet, the British version was also unsuitable for vegetarians.[30] On December 6, 2011, Kraft announced that production of Oreo biscuits was to start in the UK – their Cadbury factory in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was selected to manufacture Oreo biscuits in Britain for the first time and production began there in May 2013.[31]

Oreo cookies were introduced onto the Indian market by Cadbury India in 2011. The biscuit industry in India is estimated to be worth around 1.8 billion dollars.[32]

In Pakistan, Oreo is manufactured and sold by Lefèvre-Utile, also known as LU.</p>
